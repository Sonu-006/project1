                <h2>Prime Minister of India</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Narendra Damodardas Modi</b> born 17 September 1950 is
                    an Indian politician who has served as the 14th prime minister of India since May 2014. Modi was the
                    chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament (MP) for Varanasi. He is
                    a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right
                    wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister
                    from outside the Indian National Congress.
                    Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary
                    education. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight. His account of helping his father sell
                    tea at the Vadnagar railway station has not been reliably corroborated. At age 18, he was married to
                    Jashodaben Modi, whom he abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging her four decades later
                    when legally required to do so. Modi became a full-time worker for the RSS in Gujarat in 1971. The
                    RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until
                    2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.
